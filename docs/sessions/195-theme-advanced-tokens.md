# Session 195 — Theme advanced tokens: chrome registry, glass treatment, Glass archetype

Executes `docs/plans/theme-studio-advanced-tokens.md` (all phases). Everything is additive:
built-in themes (base/dark/agora/Stoa) and already-stored custom themes render byte-identical;
new tokens default to true no-ops; old recipes project to the exact same token set (locked by a
regression test).

## Phase A — chrome token family registered (ui 0.13.0)

`packages/ui/src/tokens.ts` gains a `chrome` group with the 24 `--cpub-topbar-*` /
`--cpub-nav-link-*` / `--cpub-footer-*` tokens (+ `--cpub-content-top-offset`) that base.css
defined since session 180 but the registry never knew about — custom themes/Studio literally
could not touch the nav bar or footer. Also registered: `sidebar-width-collapsed`,
`cpub-card-min`, `cpub-card-gap` (layout). Defaults copied verbatim from base.css and locked by
a defaults-sync test that parses base.css. Registry-only: zero rendering change; the granular
editor renders the new "Site chrome" group automatically.

**Capture-flood fix found while verifying the plan's Phase-A check:** `getComputedStyle`
substitutes `var()` inside custom-property values, so every var()-defaulted spec diffs as
"overridden" on a STOCK site — a pre-existing bug (`font-heading` etc.) that the 15
var()-defaulted chrome tokens would have amplified to ~18 phantom overrides (the "capture your
theme" banner would show for everyone). `detectAppliedOverrides` now resolves spec defaults via
`resolveVarRefs()` before diffing (`layers/base/utils/themeDiscovery.ts`, +6 tests).

## Phase B — treatment tokens (ui 0.13.0 / layer 0.72.0)

- `--surface-backdrop: none` — applied as `backdrop-filter` (+`-webkit-`) on `.cpub-sb-card`
  (components.css). `none` default is a TRUE no-op; `blur(0)` would create a stacking context +
  containing block for fixed descendants on every theme, so the default is never a zero-blur.
- `--bg-image: none` — `body { background-image: var(--bg-image, none) }` (base.css).
- **Value guard** (schema 0.40.0): `--bg-image` is the one token whose value can FETCH
  (`url()` beacon). `themeTokenMapSchema` now rejects anything but `none`/CSS gradients —
  no quotes, no backslashes (CSS-escape smuggles), no `url` substring (kills protocol-relative
  `url(//host)`). Known-bad payloads tested red (`theme-validators.test.ts`).
- CSS mirrored to `layers/base/theme/` (byte-identical copies). default.vue topbar gained the
  missing `-webkit-backdrop-filter` for older Safari.

## Phase C — Studio glass treatment (schema 0.40.0 / theme-studio 0.6.0 / layer 0.72.0)

- `ThemeRecipe.treatment?: { glass?: 0–0.3; bgGradient?: boolean }` (optional → old persisted
  recipes parse + project unchanged; `themeRecipeSchema` mirrors the bounds).
- `recipeToTokens` with glass > 0: translucent `surface` (rgba, alpha = 1−glass),
  `--surface-backdrop: blur(6+40g px) saturate(1.35)`, frosted top bar via the Phase-A chrome
  tokens (`--cpub-topbar-bg` slightly more opaque + `--cpub-topbar-blur`). Text/dim AA is
  enforced against the **flattened** composite (`blendOver` in color.ts) — tested at max
  strength across every curated palette in both modes.
- `bgGradient`: `--bg-image: linear-gradient(165deg, bg → bg tinted 7% toward accent)` — far
  stop AA-tested; emitted string asserted against a mirror of the schema allowlist so a
  generator drift fails in CI, not on the live save.
- New **Glass archetype** (frosted panels + gradient, rounded 14px, soft shadow). `ArchetypePatch`
  gains `treatment`; the wizard's `applyArchetype` now REPLACES treatment (switching Glass →
  Brutalist clears the translucency — tested).
- Wizard Feel step: Glass strength slider + "Background gradient" toggle, normalized so all-off
  stores `undefined` (keeps recipes legacy-identical). `randomizeRecipe` deliberately does NOT
  roll treatment (no surprise translucency on "Surprise me").
- AI-brief export mentions glass + page background when set.

## Phase D — wedge-gap radius audit (targeted)

Enumerated all 58 layer components using `overflow: hidden`; most uses are text-ellipsis,
avatars (explicit radius), or full-bleed page bands (no rounded parent → no wedge). Fixed the
three clear-cut edge-spanning backgrounded sections inside rounded clipped containers with
explicit `border-radius: 0` (the 0.21.21 recipe): `ContentCard .cpub-cc-thumb`,
`VideoCard .cpub-video-thumb`, `HubHero .cpub-hub-banner`. No-op at radius 0; kills the wedge
on rounded themes. The FULL per-component radius migration stays deferred (unchanged
risk/benefit since 193).

## Verification

Full workspace build green; `pnpm test` 33/33 tasks (server 1339, layer 961 incl. 14 Studio +
6 discovery, theme-studio 78, ui 27 token/radius, schema +7); `pnpm typecheck` 28/28.

## SHIPPED (same session, 2026-06-09)

PR #27 squash-merged (`decfe0f`); commonpub.io deployed from source (health 200, treatment +
chrome tokens verified in the served CSS). Published in order: **schema 0.40.0 → ui 0.13.0 →
theme-studio 0.6.0 → layer 0.72.0** (`pnpm publish:layer`; pack dry-run grep clean — zero test
files, theme CSS bundled; registry pins verified exact). CLI **create-commonpub 0.5.14** published
to crates.io (pins layer ^0.72.0 / schema ^0.40.0 / server ^2.84.1). deveco + heatsync pins
hand-edited (caret-0.x), lockfiles refreshed (schema dist complete — layout.js present), pushed +
deployed, health curl-verified.

**Typecheck post-mortem (root-caused after ship; both consumers now exit 0):** deveco's 21
"`Element` vs expanded `HTMLElement`" errors were NOT pre-existing skew — they were
contamination from this session's own `npm install --no-save <tarball>` over deveco's pnpm
layout. npm flattened real `node_modules/@vue/*` directories that pnpm never prunes, so the
program got TWO `@vue/reactivity` module instances: `ref` resolved to the top-level npm copy
while `@vue/runtime-dom`'s `RefUnwrapBailTypes` augmentation (the "don't deep-unwrap DOM
nodes" bail) applied only to the `.pnpm` copy → `ref<HTMLElement>().value` deep-mapped into
the structural flatten. The "counterfactual at 0.71.2" was invalid for the same reason (the
debris survived `git stash` + `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`). Fix: `rm -rf node_modules` +
clean pnpm install → **0 errors on deveco with layer 0.72.0**. heatsync had equivalent
npm debris (predating this session) + ONE genuine error: its `HeroSection.vue` override
declared `config?: Record<string, unknown>` while the layer's renderer binds the
`HomepageSectionConfig` INTERFACE (interfaces lack implicit index signatures), surfaced by
vue floating 3.5.30 → 3.5.34 (stricter template checks) in today's lockfile refresh — fixed
in heatsync (`605d36b`), typecheck exits 0. LESSON: never `npm install` a tarball into a pnpm
consumer for verification — use `pnpm add <tarball>` on a throwaway state, and wipe
node_modules afterward either way.

## Phase E partial — glass sweep on overlays + cards (ui 0.13.1 / layer 0.72.1)

Same-session follow-up: the `--surface-backdrop` hook (`-webkit-backdrop-filter` +
`backdrop-filter: var(--surface-backdrop, none)`, no-op by default) extended from `.cpub-sb-card`
to the 12 high-visibility surfaces: shared `.cpub-card` (layouts.css), `ContentCard .cpub-cc`,
the six modal panels (PublishErrorsModal, ImportUrlModal, ContentPicker, ShareToHubModal,
RemoteFollowDialog, MarkdownImportDialog) and the three nav overlays in default.vue
(`.cpub-nav-panel` dropdowns, `.cpub-user-dropdown`, `.cpub-mobile-nav`). Glass themes now frost
content cards, modals, and menus, not just sidebar cards. The "preview pane shows the primary
variant in both modes" follow-up from 192 was found already fixed (edit/[id].vue regenerates
preview tokens per previewMode). STILL deferred, deliberately: `border-style` token (coherence
needs touching every border declaration) and the full per-component radius migration
(105-component blast radius unchanged).

## Assumption audit (post-ship adversarial pass; fixes on PR #28)

Triggered by the npm-debris false conclusion: a sweep of every confident claim this session made.

**Real gaps found + fixed:**
- **bg-image guard had a bypass**: the generic admin settings route (`adminSettingSchema` =
  `{key, value: unknown}`) writes `instance_settings` keys wholesale, skipping
  `customThemeSchema` entirely. Fixed at the SINK: `sanitizeRenderTokens()` in
  `instanceTheme.ts` (theme-studio 0.6.1 / layer 0.72.1) drops any non-gradient `bg-image`
  before SSR injection — closes every write path at the one read path (+3 tests).
- **Glass AA only floored against the page bg**, not a modal panel over the 50% black scrim.
  Generator now floors text/text-dim against BOTH composites. Honesty note: a numeric sweep
  showed the worst curated palette was 4.53:1 (already AA) — my hand-estimate (~3.9) was
  itself a wrong assumption, so this is margin hardening (binds only for pathological
  hand-picked colors), byte-identical output for all curated palettes; the property test
  now guards it.

**Claims re-verified clean:** capture/fork flows (both `detectAppliedOverrides` callers seed
forks; no perpetual banner; the resolveVarRefs fix reduces phantom capture counts), no
unscoped `body` rules in theme CSS (gradient can't be clobbered), spec-sheet WCAG readout
guards `startsWith('#')` (rgba surfaces hide it rather than NaN), e2e failure sets between
main and the 195 PR re-diffed with full hashed test names — byte-identical (6 names), the
coarse truncated-prefix comparison happened to be right.

**Known-accepted (documented, not fixed):** chrome color tokens (`--cpub-topbar-bg` etc.)
feed `background:` shorthand, which CAN carry url() — pre-existing exposure (admin-trusted,
predates registration; a blanket sink filter could silently alter stored themes, so it
stays). `resolveVarRefs` fallback parsing doesn't handle parens-in-fallback (no current
spec default has one).

## E2E suite green + Glass browser smoke (continuation round, PR #29)

**The months-red e2e suite had ONE root cause:** `packages/schema/src/openapi.ts`'s CLI entry
guard read `process.argv[1]` at module top level. Vite's browser dev shim defines `process`
WITHOUT `argv`, so the moment `@commonpub/schema` loaded client-side, app init threw
(`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')`) and Nuxt swapped EVERY page for the 500
error screen — homepage tabs, hero banner, search, mobile nav, and console-error smoke all
failed downstream of it. Production was immune (`sideEffects: false` tree-shakes the
never-imported module out of bundles), which is why live sites worked while CI bled and local
`pnpm dev` was quietly broken. Fix: `process.argv?.[1]` (schema 0.40.1, publish pending).
Spec repairs riding along: the dark-cookie theme assertion derives the expected variant from
the configured default family (stoa since session 190) instead of hardcoding classic→dark;
login submit-button locators scoped to the login form (federated/Mastodon forms added more
type=submit buttons). Plus the docs-package vitest flake (worker birpc `onTaskUpdate` timeout
under CPU-bound load, hit CI twice today, retries don't cover run-level errors) → forks pool.
**Local result: full chromium suite 123 passed / 0 failed** (was 9 failing).

**Glass browser smoke DONE (local stack + Playwright):** bootstrap admin → created a Glass
light/dark pair via the real `/api/admin/themes` (route guards exercised: 401 anon, 403
non-admin, 200 admin), set as default → both modes screenshot-verified: accent-tinted page
gradient renders, glass surfaces + rounded geometry coherent, text readable in both modes,
Light/Dark pair flip works via cookie. Gotchas found while smoking: theme IDs are plain slugs
(`theme.default` stores the `cpub-custom-<slug>` ATTR — prefixing the id double-prefixes the
attr and silently falls back to base), and ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_FIRST_USER only helps on a virgin
DB (e2e-created users claim "first").

## Open questions / next steps

- Browser smoke after deploy: build a Glass theme via Studio → check topbar + sidebar cards over
  the gradient in light AND dark; flip the site Light/Dark toggle (pair variants carry per-mode
  treatment values); confirm `/api/admin/themes` round-trips `recipe.treatment`.
- Glass visibility is currently strongest on `.cpub-sb-card` + the topbar; scoped modals/
  dropdowns + ContentCard glass are the deferred Phase E sweep.
- Glass alpha ceiling (0.3) cleared AA at max strength across all curated palettes in tests;
  judge the AESTHETIC ceiling in the browser.
