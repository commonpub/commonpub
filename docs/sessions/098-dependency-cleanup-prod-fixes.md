# Session 098 — Dependency Cleanup & Production Fixes

## What Was Done

### Priority 1: SSR Verification ✅
- Confirmed deveco.io/project/rp2040-quad-motor-controller loads (HTTP 200, full render)
- Confirmed commonpub.io homepage loads (HTTP 200, full render)
- SSR fix from session 097 (dompurify removal) is deployed and working

### Priority 3: Dependency Cleanup ✅
- **@commonpub/docs**: Removed `isomorphic-dompurify` dependency
  - `sanitizeHtml` export was redundant — `renderMarkdown` already runs `rehype-sanitize`
  - Removed `sanitizeHtml` from docs export, updated 2 layer pages to use pre-sanitized HTML
  - Published `@commonpub/docs@0.5.2`
- **@commonpub/auth**: Investigated vitest peer dep — it's an **optional** peer from better-auth, not installed in production. No action needed.
- Deprecated `@commonpub/docs@0.5.1` and `@commonpub/layer@0.3.5` (published with `npm publish` which didn't resolve `workspace:*` refs — must always use `pnpm publish`)

### Priority 5: drizzle-kit in Production ✅
- Root cause: `drizzle.config.ts` required TypeScript compilation in Alpine runtime container
- Fix: Converted to `drizzle.config.js` (schema already points to compiled JS at `./schema/dist/*.js`)
- Updated Dockerfile to copy `.js` config, deploy workflow passes `--config=drizzle.config.js`

### Priority 6: Technical Debt ✅
- **CLI template versions**: Updated `@commonpub/layer` from `^0.2.0` to `^0.3.0` (critical — `^0.2.0` can't resolve `0.3.x` under semver 0.x rules)
- **CI simplification**: Removed macOS from matrix (build was skipped, Postgres unavailable, redundant with ubuntu-only e2e)
- All 13 Rust CLI tests pass after version update
- All 122 docs tests pass after dompurify removal

### Layer Publish
- Published `@commonpub/layer@0.3.6` with resolved workspace deps
- Updated deveco-io to `^0.3.6`, pushed to trigger auto-deploy

## Decisions Made

1. **No separate backfill script for share card N+1** — refederation will re-trigger Announce handling, populating `sharedContentMeta` for existing posts
2. **Always use `pnpm publish`** for monorepo packages — `npm publish` doesn't resolve `workspace:*` protocol
3. **drizzle.config as .js** in production — `.ts` stays in schema package (devDeps available) and CLI template (dev environment)

## What Still Needs Doing

### Needs User Action
- **Priority 2: Refederate** — trigger from https://commonpub.io/admin/federation to backfill cpub:blocks and sharedContentMeta
- **Priority 4: Hub content verification** — check federated hub tabs after refederation

### Remaining Technical Debt
- Fork endpoint for federated content (new feature)
- CLI: bump to v0.5.1 and republish binary after template version update
- Share card N+1 will resolve after refederation (no code change needed)

### Federation Interoperability Audit
- Comprehensive audit of every local vs federated feature stored in `docs/federation-interop-audit.md`
- Found 7 bugs (broken buttons, missing update fields, ExplainerView missing like)
- Found 12 missing features (notifications not wired, comments write-only, no fork, etc.)
- Documented 12 intentionally-not-federated features
- Created phased implementation plan (A through E)
- Session 099 handoff prompt stored in `docs/sessions/099-handoff-prompt.md`

## Published Packages
- `@commonpub/docs@0.5.2` — no dompurify, no sanitizeHtml export
- `@commonpub/layer@0.3.7` — CLI refederation support, docs cleanup
- Deprecated: `@commonpub/docs@0.5.1`, `@commonpub/layer@0.3.5`, `@commonpub/layer@0.3.6` (broken workspace refs / intermediate)
