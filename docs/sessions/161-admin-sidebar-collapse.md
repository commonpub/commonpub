# Session 161 — Admin sidebar collapsible on desktop

**Date**: 2026-05-28 (continuation of 160's R5 audit close)
**Branch**: `main` (commonpub.io workspace, no npm publishes)
**Trigger**: User reported via screenshot — on `/admin/layouts/[id]` the editor's 3-column palette/canvas/inspector gets squeezed because the admin sidebar is fixed-width on desktop. Canvas content wraps; content-card thumbnails clip mid-word ("VIDEO/AYBACK SYSTE").
**Driving rule**: CLAUDE.md #2 (no feature without a flag — N/A here; this is admin chrome UX, not a feature) + #3 (`var(--*)` only) + #11 (TDD) + #12 (WCAG 2.1 AA) + audit memory [[feedback-visual-editor-ux-patterns]] ("cursor as contract — UI must not lie").

## What was done

### 1. `useAdminSidebar` composable (new — `layers/base/composables/useAdminSidebar.ts`, ~95 LOC)

State machine with three axes:
- **`userPref` (persisted)** — `useState<boolean>('cpub-admin-sidebar-pref', () => false)`, hydrated from `localStorage['cpub-admin-sidebar-collapsed']` in `onMounted`. Survives reloads.
- **`sessionOverride` (transient)** — `useState<boolean | null>('cpub-admin-sidebar-override', () => null)`. Non-null only when the user manually toggled while on an editor route. `watch(() => route.path)` resets it to `null` on every route change.
- **`mobileOpen` (separate)** — `useState<boolean>('cpub-admin-sidebar-mobile-open', () => false)`. Independent of desktop collapse.

Editor routes regex:
```ts
const EDITOR_ROUTE_PATTERNS = [
  /^\/admin\/layouts\/[^/]+$/,       // /admin/layouts/[id]
  /^\/admin\/theme\/edit\/[^/]+$/,   // /admin/theme/edit/[id]
];
```
(`/admin/layouts` list page is NOT an editor — only the `/[id]` detail page auto-collapses.)

Computed:
```ts
desktopCollapsed = sessionOverride ?? (isEditorRoute ? true : userPref)
```

Toggle behavior:
- **On editor route**: sets `sessionOverride`. Does NOT persist to localStorage. Resets on route change so the next visit gets auto-collapsed again.
- **Off editor route**: sets `userPref` + writes to localStorage. Clears any leftover `sessionOverride`.

SSR safety: `typeof window === 'undefined'` guard on both the hydrate read and the persist write (deliberately NOT `import.meta.client` — that's a Nuxt build-time replacement and is `undefined` in vitest, which silently breaks the hydration path. See feedback memory below.)

### 2. Tests (`layers/base/composables/__tests__/useAdminSidebar.test.ts`, 17 tests, all passing)

Covers:
- Defaults: not collapsed on `/admin` with no localStorage; `isEditorRoute` false; `mobileOpen` false
- Hydration: reads `true` / `false` correctly, ignores bogus values, survives a localStorage that throws (private mode)
- Toggle on non-editor route persists to localStorage in both directions
- Editor routes (`/admin/layouts/:id`, `/admin/theme/edit/:id`) auto-collapse; list page (`/admin/layouts`, `/admin/theme`) does NOT
- Toggle on editor route writes to `sessionOverride`, NOT to localStorage
- Route change clears `sessionOverride` so leaving editor returns to `userPref`
- Returning to editor route after override-then-leave goes back to auto-collapsed
- Mobile drawer independent: toggling desktop never touches `mobileOpen`
- `userPref=collapsed` survives navigation to/from editor route

### 3. CSS token (`packages/ui/theme/base.css` — the canonical source)

Added one line:
```css
--sidebar-width-collapsed: 3.5rem; /* 56px icons-only — admin chrome collapsed state */
```
Sibling to the existing `--sidebar-width: 12.5rem` (200px).

**`layers/base/theme/base.css` is gitignored** — it's a bundled copy produced by `layers/base/scripts/bundle-theme.mjs` on `prepublishOnly`. Editing it directly is a no-op for git. The layer's `nuxt.config.ts` falls through to `packages/ui/theme/` if `layers/base/theme/` doesn't exist (fresh clones / clean deploys). I re-ran `node layers/base/scripts/bundle-theme.mjs` to sync the bundled copy for local dev parity.

(I caught this only because `git status` showed no change after my first edit. Both heatsync + deveco get the new CSS token when they next upgrade `@commonpub/layer` from 0.24.0 — the token ships in the layer tarball via the prepublishOnly bundle.)

### 4. `layers/base/layouts/admin.vue` refactor

- Replaced inline `const sidebarOpen = ref(false)` with destructured `useAdminSidebar()` API
- Added a topbar chevron toggle button (`fa-angles-left` ↔ `fa-angles-right`) with `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls="admin-sidebar-nav"` + `:title` for tooltip + mirrored `:aria-label`
- Mobile hamburger button gained `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls` (was missing — quiet accessibility upgrade)
- Each nav link's label text wrapped in `<span class="admin-nav-label">…</span>` so labels can fade smoothly while staying in the DOM (screen readers continue to announce the link name — `display:none` would have hidden them from SRs, `clip-path`/`opacity:0+max-width:0` does not)
- `:title="desktopCollapsed ? 'Dashboard' : undefined"` — visual hover tooltip only when collapsed. Avoids double-announce when expanded.
- CSS sidebar transitions `width var(--transition-default)`; labels transition `opacity` + `max-width`
- Mobile media query (≤768px) resets sidebar width to 220px regardless of `desktopCollapsed` (mobile is a drawer, not a collapse) — uses `!important` to override the desktop modifier classes' specificity. Mobile labels always visible.

### 5. Codebase-analysis updates

- `05-layer-pages-components.md`: composable count 20 → 21; layouts entry tagged with "collapsible sidebar, session 161"; new "Admin chrome (session 161)" sub-section under Admin pages; `useAdminSidebar` row added to Composables table; `/admin/layouts` + `/admin/layouts/:id` finally listed under Admin pages
- `10-doc-audit.md`: appended "/admin/layouts editor + sidebar collapse from sessions 160–161" to the two existing stale-admin-doc entries (`admin.md`, `admin-and-permissions.md`)
- `11-codebase-stats.md`: added Session 161 deltas block; bumped header date; mentioned 0 npm publishes (workspace-only)

### 6. Deferred queue + handoff

- `docs/sessions/161-handoff-prompt.md` P2 "Admin sidebar collapsible on desktop" entry struck through with "DONE in session 161" + link to this doc

## Decisions

- **Composable name `useAdminSidebar`** (not `useSidebar`): explicitly scoped to admin chrome. The default site nav has its own concerns; we don't want a generic helper that conflates them.
- **`localStorage` key `cpub-admin-sidebar-collapsed`** (not `cpub.admin.sidebar.collapsed` as the deferred-queue placeholder suggested): the existing codebase uses dash-separated `cpub-*` keys (`cpub-theme`, `cpub-theme-editor-seed`). Consistency with the prior art wins.
- **Editor-route auto-collapse with session override** (not just "always collapsed when in editor"): mirrors Linear/Figma/Notion patterns. The user sees their canvas-first default but can override per visit when they need to nav. The override resets on route change — they don't have to remember to un-toggle.
- **`typeof window` over `import.meta.client`**: see feedback memory below. The composable's hydration was silently bailing in tests because `import.meta.client` is `undefined` in vitest (not a Nuxt build-time replacement there). Making the guard portable doesn't lose anything in production.
- **Topbar toggle, not in-sidebar toggle**: Linear puts it at the bottom of the sidebar; Notion puts it in the topbar; Figma puts it in the topbar. The topbar approach means the toggle stays in the same screen position whether the sidebar is collapsed or expanded — no "where did the button go" moment. The sidebar collapse animation feels cleaner without a button moving with it.
- **`aria-controls="admin-sidebar-nav"`**: both the mobile hamburger and the desktop chevron point at the same sidebar element. The sidebar's `<aside>` gets an `id`. Standard ARIA pattern for disclosure controls.
- **No tooltips beyond `title=`**: native browser tooltips are slow but accessible by default. A custom CSS tooltip would be polish, not a correctness fix; deferred until someone complains.

## Test counts (touched packages)

| Package | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@commonpub/layer` | 264 | **281** | **+17** |
| `pnpm typecheck` | 26/26 | 26/26 | unchanged |

All other test counts unchanged (no schema, server, or other package files touched).

## Memories captured

### `feedback-vitest-import-meta-client-undefined`
`import.meta.client` is `undefined` in vitest unit tests (it's a Nuxt build-time replacement, not part of `import.meta`'s ES spec). Composables that guard browser-only code with `if (!import.meta.client) return` will silently bail in tests, masking bugs (or, worse, providing false-positive coverage of the early-return branch). Prefer `typeof window === 'undefined'` for portability — works in jsdom, real browsers, and Node SSR equivalently. Caught in session 161 when `useAdminSidebar` hydration was silently bailing; one half of the tests passed only because they happened to be testing the default-`false` state.

### `feedback-vi-restoreallmocks-wipes-vifn-impls`
`vi.restoreAllMocks()` in afterEach RESETS the implementation of any `vi.fn(impl)` mock (not just spies) — leaving the function returning `undefined` for the next test, even if you re-assign the same module-level vi.fn reference in beforeEach. Caught in session 161 when the `useState` mock returned `undefined` on the 2nd test in a file, breaking everything. Use `vi.clearAllMocks()` if you only want to clear call history; reserve `restoreAllMocks` for files that use `vi.spyOn()` exclusively.

## Open questions

None.

## Next steps

Back to the session 161 fork:
- **Path A**: Phase 3b drag-drop (2 sessions, big feature) — wires `grid-layout-plus@1.1.1` + `@vue-dnd-kit/core@2.4.6`
- **Path B**: schema-package refactor (1 session, closes R2's deferred per-section configSchema enforcement)

Defaults still apply: NEVER trust `gh run list`, always curl `/api/health` after deploy; no AI attribution in commits; commonpub.io is the test bed.

## Post-script: audit polish (session 161 round 3)

Audited my own work and caught a real P2: SSR/CSR **hydration flash**. Server rendered with `userPref: false` (the useState default), client mounted, `onMounted` read `localStorage`, flipped to `true` → visible ~100ms snap from expanded to collapsed on the first page load.

**Fix**: switched `userPref` from `useState` + `localStorage` to **`useCookie`** — matches the existing `useTheme.ts` pattern (which also uses cookies for the same SSR-correctness reason). Nuxt's `useCookie` reads the cookie on the server during SSR, so the first render uses the actual value. No flash.

Cookie config: `maxAge: 1 year`, `path: '/'`, `sameSite: 'lax'`. Cookie only emitted when the user actually toggles — Nuxt's `useCookie` doesn't write `Set-Cookie` for unchanged default values.

Also dropped the now-unused `URL_LINK_OR_EMPTY` regex constant from `packages/schema/src/sectionConfigs.ts` (every current caller pairs the link regex with `.min(1)`, making the empty branch dead; YAGNI). Added a comment explaining why `URL_LINK_STRICT` has no `_OR_EMPTY` counterpart.

Test counts after polish: layer 287 → 286 (-1; dropped 2 localStorage-specific tests, added 1 cookie-default test). Schema 470 unchanged.
